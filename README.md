# MC-Lua
This repo will contain all of my Lua scripts which I have written for ComputerCraft.
ComputerCraft is a mod for Minecraft that adds computers, which can be programmed with Lua.

### Installation
- In Minecraft, you must first have a computer crafted and placed in the world.
- Next, we will use ```wget``` to download the ```getScripts.lua``` file. Open the computer and enter this command:
    - ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preassume/MC-Lua/main/getScripts.lua getScripts```
    - This will download the file directly onto the computer and name it ```getScripts```
- Now, all we have to do is run ```getScripts``` by typing it into the computer.
    - This will automatically download all other scripts to your computer.
